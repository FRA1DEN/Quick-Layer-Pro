  "changelog": "Changelog:\n\nNew:\n– Automatic marker analysis for text creation:\n  When layers are selected, QuickLayer Pro now automatically scans for marker patterns.\n  If a marker with a comment is followed by an empty marker, a text layer is generated using the comment as content and the range between markers as duration.\n  ➤ No need to manually enter “Markers” in the input field anymore.\n\nImprovements:\n– Precompose enhancements:\n  • Audio management: The audio state of the source layer is now preserved. In single mode, audio is enabled in the pre-comp if any selected layer had it active.\n  • Visibility management: Pre-comps created from audio layers now automatically have visibility turned off.\n– Keyframe generation logic:\n  • Creating animation keyframes no longer skips the first keyframe if it already exists — it is treated as the starting point.\n– Interface updates:\n  • The pre-compose mode toggle has been moved to the context menu.\n  • Added new \"Layer\" mode: pre-compositions are created using the resolution and position of the selected layer, instead of the full composition.\n\nFixes:\n– Null object parenting bug:\n  • When creating multiple nulls, selected layers are now correctly parented to each new null instead of reusing the previous one.\n– Keyframe cleanup:\n  • When deleting the first keyframe, remaining keyframes now shift properly without creating timing gaps.\n– Context menu color issue:\n  • Fixed an issue where the selected color was not correctly displayed in the context menu.",
